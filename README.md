Welcome! This tutorial is based on the CMake tutorial of `IPADS` in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. You can find the [original repository](https://github.com/richardchien/modern-cmake-by-example) and the [video](htttps://www.bilibili.com/video/BV14h41187FZ).

This tutorial focuses on a simple project, which is a basic question and answer program. Through the process of developing this project, we will learn how to use CMake to manage the project and learn about modern cmake features step by step.

So let's get started! Type `git checkout step00` to start off. Happy hacking!
